The Implementation phase for the map reader for the blind

"A customer has placed an order for Map Reader App that users who are blind could use it to walk their dog within the neighborhood."

Implementation + Testing Phase: functional code is key, does the implemented functions satisfy the goal of the product design? I will also look for changes made to previous milestones (based on previous feedback)  that improves the quality of the product, defects found and fixed any refactoring done and if the product is "partially" working.
